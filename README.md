## Using with Claude and Cursor

To make Jira MCP work with Claude and Cursor, you need to add configuration to your Cursor settings.

### Step 1: Install Jira MCP
Choose one of the installation methods above (Docker recommended).

### Step 2: Configure Cursor
1. Open Cursor
2. Go to Settings > MCP > Add MCP Server
3. Add the following configuration:

#### Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_HOST=your_jira_instance.atlassian.net",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your_atlassian_api_token",
        "jira-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Using Local Binary
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "/path/to/jira-mcp",
      "args": ["-env", "/path/to/.env"]
    }
  }
